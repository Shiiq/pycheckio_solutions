# Youâ€™ve received a letter from a friend whom you haven't
# seen or heard from for a while. In this letter he gives you instructions
# on how to find a hidden treasure!
#
# In this mission you should follow a given list of
# instructions which will get you to a certain point on the map.
# A list of instructions is a string, each letter of this string points you
# in the direction of your next step.
#
# The letter "f" - tells you to move forward, "b" - backward, "l" - left, and "r" - right.
#
# It means that if the list of your instructions is "fflff" then you
# should move forward two times, make one step to the left and then again move two times forward.
#
# Now, let's imagine that you are in the position (0, 0).
# If you move forward your position will change to (0, 1). If you move again it will be (0, 2).
# If your next step is to the left then your position will become (-1, 2).
# After the next two steps forward your coordinates will be (-1, 4).
#
# Your goal is to find your final coordinates. Like in our case they are (-1, 4).
