# In computer science, a queue is a particular kind of data type
# in which the entities in the collection are kept in order and
# the principal operations on the collection are the addition of
# entities to the rear terminal position (enqueue or push),
# and removal of entities from the front terminal position (dequeue or pop).
# This makes the queue a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structure.
# In a FIFO data structure, the first element added to the queue will be
# the first one to be removed. This is equivalent to the requirement that
# once a new element is added, all elements that were added before have
# to be removed before the new element can be removed.
#
# We will emulate the queue process with Python. You are given a sequence of commands:
# - "PUSH X" -- enqueue X , where X is a letter in uppercase.
# - "POP" -- dequeue the front position. if the queue is empty, then do nothing.
# The queue can only contain letters.
#
# You should process all commands and assemble letters which remain in the queue in one word from the front to the rear of the queue.
#
# Let's look at an example, hereâ€™s the sequence of commands:
# ["PUSH A", "POP", "POP", "PUSH Z", "PUSH D", "PUSH O", "POP", "PUSH T"]

# letter_queue(['PUSH A',
#  'POP',
#  'POP',
#  'PUSH Z',
#  'PUSH D',
#  'PUSH O',
#  'POP',
#  'PUSH T']) == 'DOT'
# letter_queue(['POP', 'POP']) == ''
# letter_queue(['PUSH H', 'PUSH I']) == 'HI'
# letter_queue([]) == ''
INPUT = ['PUSH A', 'POP', 'POP', 'PUSH Z', 'PUSH D', 'PUSH O', 'POP', 'PUSH T']
