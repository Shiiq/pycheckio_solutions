# Tic-Tac-Toe, sometimes also known as Xs and Os, is a game for two players (X and O)
# who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in
# placing three respective marks in a horizontal, vertical,
# or diagonal rows (NW-SE and NE-SW) wins the game.
#
# But we will not be playing this game. You will be the referee for this games results.
# You are given a result of a game and you must determine if the game ends
# in a win or a draw as well as who will be the winner. Make sure to return "X"
# if the X-player wins and "O" if the O-player wins. If the game is a draw, return "D".
