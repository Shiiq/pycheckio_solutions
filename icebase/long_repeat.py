# There are four substring missions that were born all in one day
# and you shouldnâ€™t need more than one day to solve them.
# All of these missions can be simply solved by brute force,
# but is it always the best way to go?
# (You might not have access to all of those missions yet,
# but they are going to be available with more opened islands on the map).
#
# This mission is the first one of the series.
# Here you should find the length of the longest substring
# that consists of the same letter.
# For example, line "aaabbcaaaa" contains
# four substrings with the same letters "aaa", "bb","c" and "aaaa".
# The last substring is the longest one, which makes it the answer.
